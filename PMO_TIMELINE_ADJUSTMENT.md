  - Parallel competitive analysis
  - Use existing market research data
- **Contingency**: Proceed with 50+ responses minimum

#### Risk 2: Authentication Complexity
- **Probability**: High (60%)
- **Impact**: Medium (2-day delay)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use established auth libraries (Passport.js)
  - Start with OAuth2, add SSO in v2
  - Engage security consultant for 4 hours
- **Contingency**: Ship with OAuth2 only, SSO as fast-follow

#### Risk 3: Performance Requirements
- **Probability**: Low (20%)
- **Impact**: High (4-day delay)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Early performance testing (Week 4)
  - Use proven async patterns
  - Cloud-based load testing services
- **Contingency**: Scale targets for v2 release

#### Risk 4: Market Timing
- **Probability**: Medium (35%)
- **Impact**: Very High (competitive disadvantage)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Early beta program (Week 5)
  - Phased feature release
  - Strong launch marketing
- **Contingency**: Accelerate MVP features, enterprise features in v2
