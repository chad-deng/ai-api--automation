# AI API Test Automation Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Project Type**: API-focused test automation framework
**Development Approach**: Claude Development Checklist v2.1-HYBRID (15-stage process)
**Primary Focus**: Test-driven development with enterprise-level quality gates

## 📋 5-Part Structured Prompt Definition

### 1. Background
This project aims to create a comprehensive API test automation framework that enables efficient testing of REST APIs with advanced capabilities including contract testing, performance validation, and automated test generation.

### 2. Description
**MVP Scope (Weeks 1-8)**: Core API testing framework focused on:
- ✅ Automated test case generation from OpenAPI specs
- ✅ OpenAPI/Swagger validation and parsing (90.17% coverage)
- ✅ Basic authentication support (API key, Bearer token)
- CLI interface for test generation and validation

**Future Scope (v2.0+)**: Enterprise features deferred post-MVP:
- Performance and load testing capabilities
- Advanced CI/CD pipeline integration
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics
- Multi-format API support (GraphQL, gRPC)

### 3. Platform (MVP)
- **Backend**: TypeScript/Node.js (✅ Implemented)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest (✅ Primary framework)
- **API Support**: OpenAPI/Swagger REST APIs (✅ Core focus)
- **Authentication**: API Key, Bearer Token (✅ Basic auth only)
- **Build System**: npm scripts, TypeScript compiler (✅ Working)

### 4. Visual Style
- **CLI Interface**: Clean, informative terminal output
- **Reports**: Professional HTML/PDF test reports
- **Documentation**: Clear, developer-friendly markdown

### 5. Components
- Test case generator
- API contract validator
- Performance test runner
- Results aggregator and reporter
- CI/CD integration modules

## 🚀 Development Commands

### Setup Commands (✅ Working)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Build project (TypeScript compilation)
npm run build

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- --testPathPattern="validator"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="auth"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="parser"
```

### Quality Metrics (Current Status)
```bash
# Coverage Status:
# - OpenAPI Validator: 90.17% statements ✅
# - OpenAPI Parser: 76% statements ✅
# - Auth System: 65.21% statements ✅
# - Data Generator: 79.5% statements ✅
# - Overall Build: ✅ PASSING
```

## 🔧 Important Rules

### File Management Rules
- **NEVER use `rm` command** - Always use `trash` command for file deletion
- Preserve existing files unless explicitly required to modify
- Use `Edit` tool for modifications, `Write` only for new files

### Git Commit Rules
- **Automatic commits**: Required at stage/sprint/milestone completion
- **Commit format**: Use conventional commit format
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation
  - `test:` for tests
  - `refactor:` for refactoring
  - `chore:` for maintenance

### Development Rules
- **TDD First**: Always write tests before implementation
- **Quality Gates**: Must pass all quality checks before stage progression
- **API Focus**: Emphasize integration testing over visual testing
- **Coverage**: Maintain >90% test coverage

## 🤖 Automated Review Hooks

### Stage Review Triggers
- **Stage 2 (Problem Statement)**: `global-pmo-director` for business alignment
- **Stage 3 (Deep Research)**: `enterprise-tech-lead` for technical feasibility
- **Stage 5 (PRD)**: `project-requirements-analyst` for requirements validation
- **Stage 8 (Technical Architecture)**: `enterprise-tech-lead` + `devops-infrastructure-engineer`
- **Stage 9 (Implementation Plan)**: `enterprise-tech-lead` for TDD strategy
- **Stage 11 (TDD Implementation)**: `global-qa-lead` for quality assurance
- **Stage 12 (Review)**: `global-qa-lead` + `enterprise-tech-lead` for final validation

### Quality Gate Hooks
- **Pre-merge**: Automated testing, linting, type checking
- **Post-deployment**: Performance monitoring, health checks
- **Documentation**: Automated documentation updates
