## üìã **Updated User Stories**

### **Epic 3: QA Review Workflow** (Updated)
```gherkin
As a QA Lead
I want to efficiently review and approve generated tests
So that high-quality tests enter our test suite quickly

Acceptance Criteria:
‚úÖ Given generated test files are available
‚úÖ When I access the review dashboard
‚úÖ Then I see tests grouped by API endpoint with syntax highlighting
‚úÖ And I can approve/reject tests with required feedback comments
‚úÖ And I can perform bulk operations on related tests
‚úÖ And approved tests are automatically committed to generated-tests branch
‚úÖ And rejected tests trigger auto-regeneration with feedback context
‚úÖ And move failures are escalated to DevOps with detailed error logs
```
