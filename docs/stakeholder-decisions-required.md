# Stakeholder Decisions Required

## Summary of Stakeholder Input

✅ **Product Owner**: Provided clear business requirements and feature priorities
✅ **QA Lead**: Defined quality standards and realistic review timelines  
✅ **Tech Lead**: Recommended technical architecture for 8-week MVP delivery

## Conflicts Requiring PMO/Stakeholder Decision

### 1. User Permissions Priority Contradiction

**Conflict**: S1 lists "user permissions" as "Must Have" but WH2 says "single team, not multi-tenant"

**Stakeholder Recommendations**:
- **PO**: Remove from MVP - Focus on core value delivery
- **QA Lead**: Agrees - Not needed for single team
- **Tech Lead**: Remove - Saves 1-2 weeks development time

**Options**:
1. ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Remove user permissions from MVP
   - **Impact**: Saves 1-2 weeks development time
   - **Risk**: None for single-team deployment
   - **Business Value**: Focus resources on core test generation

2. Implement basic role separation (QA vs Admin)
   - **Impact**: Adds 1 week development time
   - **Risk**: Feature creep, reduced focus on core value

3. Keep full permission system as planned
   - **Impact**: Adds 2 weeks development time
   - **Risk**: Jeopardizes 8-week timeline

**Decision Needed**: Which option should we proceed with?

### 2. Error Handling Scope vs Timeline

**Conflict**: Comprehensive error handling desired vs 8-week MVP timeline constraints

**Stakeholder Recommendations**:
- **PO**: Hybrid approach - Smart handling for common errors, manual for edge cases
- **QA Lead**: Supports hybrid with focus on quality gates
- **Tech Lead**: Recommends production-grade retry for webhooks, manual for git/filesystem

**Options**:
1. ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Hybrid Error Handling
   - **Automated**: Webhook failures, test generation errors, signature validation
   - **Manual**: Git conflicts, filesystem issues, template logic errors
   - **Impact**: Balances reliability with development speed
   - **Timeline**: Fits within 8-week constraint

2. Minimal error handling only
   - **Impact**: Faster development but operational burden
   - **Risk**: High support overhead, poor user experience

3. Comprehensive error recovery
   - **Impact**: Robust system but 2+ weeks additional development
   - **Risk**: Timeline overrun

**Decision Needed**: Approve hybrid approach or select alternative?

### 3. Review Interface Scope

**Conflict**: Rich UI features desired vs rapid MVP delivery

**Current Consensus**:
- **PO**: MVP features defined (syntax highlighting, diff view, bulk actions)
- **QA Lead**: Supports proposed features for 15-minute review target
- **Tech Lead**: FastAPI + HTMX for rapid development

**No Decision Required**: All stakeholders aligned on MVP scope

---

### 4. Data Storage Strategy

**Conflict**: SQLite simplicity vs PostgreSQL scalability

**Current Consensus**:
- **PO**: Supports pragmatic approach
- **QA Lead**: No preference, needs reliability
- **Tech Lead**: SQLite for MVP with PostgreSQL migration path

**No Decision Required**: Technical decision made with clear migration path

---

## Recommended Decisions

Based on stakeholder input and business priorities:

### ✅ **APPROVE**: Remove User Permissions from MVP
**Rationale**:
- Unanimous stakeholder agreement
- Saves 1-2 weeks critical development time
- No business impact for single-team deployment
- Can be added post-MVP if multi-team expansion needed

### ✅ **APPROVE**: Hybrid Error Handling Approach
**Rationale**:
- Balances reliability with timeline constraints
- Covers 90% of operational scenarios automatically
- Provides clear escalation path for edge cases
- Supported by all stakeholders

### Updated MVP Scope
With these decisions:
- **Timeline**: Remains 8 weeks
- **Core Features**: All maintained
- **Development Focus**: 100% on test generation and review workflow
- **Risk Reduction**: Simplified scope reduces delivery risk

## Impact on Project Timeline

| Week | Focus Area | Impact of Decisions |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | Webhook + Basic Generation | ✅ Unchanged |
| 3-4 | Template Engine + Quality | ✅ More time for quality |
| 5-6 | Review Workflow | ✅ More time for UX polish |
| 7-8 | Integration + Polish | ✅ Buffer time available |

**Net Result**: Decisions create 1-2 weeks of buffer time for quality and polish while maintaining all core business value.
