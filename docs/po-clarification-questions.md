# PRD Clarification Questions for Product Owner

## High Priority - Core Workflow Clarifications

### 1. Test Rejection Workflow (Epic 3)
**Current Requirement:** "Rejected tests are marked for regeneration"

**Questions:**
- What specific actions occur during "regeneration"?
- How do we differentiate between:
  - Transient errors (network issues, temporary API problems)
  - Systemic template/logic flaws requiring developer intervention
- Should rejected tests include feedback mechanism for QA to explain rejection reasons?
- Who receives notifications when tests are rejected and need attention?

### 2. Test Approval Workflow (Epic 3)
**Current Requirement:** "Approved tests are moved to the test suite"

**Questions:**
- What does "moved" mean technically?
  - Git commit to main branch?
  - File system operation?
  - Database state change?
- What happens if the "move" operation fails?
- Should approved tests be immediately executable or require additional integration steps?

### 3. Review Interface Requirements (FR3.1)
**Current Requirement:** "Web browser interface for reviewing generated tests"

**Questions:**
- What specific features are required for effective code review?
  - Syntax highlighting?
  - Diff view showing changes?
  - Line-by-line commenting?
  - Side-by-side comparison with original specifications?
- How should multiple tests be presented for batch review?
- Any integration requirements with existing code review tools?

## Medium Priority - Technical Architecture

### 4. Data Storage Strategy (NFR3.3)
**Current Requirement:** "Daily automated backups"

**Questions:**
- What data store should track test states (pending/approved/rejected)?
  - SQLite for simplicity?
  - JSON files for transparency?
  - External database for scalability?
- What specific data needs daily backup?
- What's the recovery process if backup restoration is needed?

### 5. Notification System (Epic 1)
**Current Requirement:** "Notifies QA team of new tests available for review"

**Questions:**
- What notification channels are preferred?
  - Slack integration?
  - Email alerts?
  - Teams notifications?
  - Dashboard-only (passive checking)?
- What information should notifications include?
- How should notification frequency be managed to avoid spam?

### 6. Webhook Retry Policy (FR1.5)
**Current Requirement:** "Implement retry mechanism for failed webhook deliveries"

**Questions:**
- What retry strategy is acceptable?
  - How many retry attempts?
  - What backoff strategy (exponential, linear)?
  - Maximum retry window?
- How should permanent failures be handled?
- What constitutes a retryable vs non-retryable error?

## Low Priority - Scope Clarifications

### 7. User Permissions Priority (S1 vs WH2)
**Contradiction:** "User permissions" listed as "Must Have" but WH2 says "single team, not multi-tenant"

**Questions:**
- Is user permission management actually needed for V1?
- If yes, what level of permission control is required?
- Should this be deprioritized to focus on core value delivery?

### 8. Error Handling Scope
**Questions:**
- How should the system handle partial failures (some tests generated, others failed)?
- What visibility do users need into system errors vs test generation errors?
- Should there be different error recovery flows for different failure types?

## Recommended Meeting Structure

1. **Start with High Priority items** - these directly impact user workflow
2. **Address Technical Architecture** - needed for accurate effort estimation  
3. **Clarify Scope items** - ensure V1 boundaries are realistic

## Expected Outcomes

After this discussion, we should have:
- Clear definition of rejection/approval workflows
- Specified notification strategy
- Chosen data storage approach
- Defined retry policies
- Confirmed V1 scope boundaries

This will enable accurate technical planning and reduce implementation risks.
