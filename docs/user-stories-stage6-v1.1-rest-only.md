## Executive Summary

This document transforms the 27 detailed requirements from our updated PRD v1.1 into actionable user stories with comprehensive acceptance criteria, **focused exclusively on REST API testing with OpenAPI/Swagger support**. Following PMO Director review and executive decision, this REST-only MVP eliminates multi-protocol complexity to deliver enterprise-grade TypeScript Jest test generation within budget and timeline constraints.

**Core Value Proposition**: "Zero-configuration TypeScript Jest test generation for REST APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger that works in under 30 seconds"

**PMO Decision Rationale**:
- **Risk Mitigation**: Multi-protocol scope represented 250% expansion from original MVP
- **Budget Alignment**: Maintains $81,500 allocation vs $95,000+ for multi-protocol
- **Timeline Certainty**: 100 story points achievable in 10 weeks vs 162 points for multi-protocol
- **Market Focus**: REST APIs represent 85%+ of enterprise API landscape
- **Quality First**: Deep REST expertise vs shallow multi-protocol coverage

### Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risk**: Focused REST scope reduces complexity
- **Performance Risk**: <30 second target achievable with single protocol
- **Quality Risk**: Enhanced focus on TypeScript AST generation
- **Timeline Risk**: Conservative 10 points/week average with buffer
- **Budget Risk**: Eliminated $13,500 multi-protocol cost overrun
