## 📋 **5-Day Validation Schedule**

### **Day 1: Technical Proof of Concept**
**Goal**: Validate core technical assumptions

#### **Morning (4 hours): Build Basic Prototype**
```bash
# Create minimal prototype structure
mkdir mvp-prototype
cd mvp-prototype
npm init -y
npm install commander handlebars js-yaml @types/node typescript

# Files to create:
# - src/cli.ts (basic CLI)
# - src/parser.ts (OpenAPI parser)
# - src/generator.ts (template generator)
# - templates/jest-test.hbs
# - test with sample OpenAPI spec
```

**Prototype Scope**:
- CLI that accepts OpenAPI file
- Parse JSON/YAML OpenAPI spec
- Generate basic Jest test using Handlebars
- Test with 2-3 real OpenAPI specs

#### **Afternoon (4 hours): Test with Real APIs**
**Test Cases**:
1. **Simple API**: Petstore OpenAPI (basic CRUD)
2. **Medium Complexity**: Stripe API (auth + nested objects)
3. **Complex API**: GitHub API (complex schemas + auth)

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Templates handle all 3 API complexities
- [ ] Generated tests compile without errors
- [ ] Generated tests can run (even if they fail API calls)
- [ ] Performance: <5 seconds per API (scaled projection)

### **Day 2: User Problem Validation**
**Goal**: Confirm target users have the problem and want this solution

#### **Morning (4 hours): Target User Interviews**
**Interview 10 developers** (2 hours preparation + 2 hours interviews):

**Target Profile**: Senior/Mid-level developers using TypeScript + Jest + APIs

**Key Questions**:
1. **Problem Validation**:
   - How do you currently test your APIs?
   - How long does it take to write API tests?
   - What's most painful about API testing?

2. **Solution Validation**:
   - Show prototype demo
   - Would you use this tool?
   - What would make you adopt vs. not adopt?

3. **Requirements Validation**:
   - Is Jest-only sufficient or do you need other frameworks?
   - What OpenAPI features are critical?
   - How important is advanced security validation?

#### **Afternoon (4 hours): Competitive Analysis**
**Research existing solutions**:
- Postman test generation
- OpenAPI code generators
- Manual testing approaches
- Current developer workflows

**Validation Questions**:
- Is our solution significantly better?
- What's the competitive advantage?
- Why haven't existing solutions solved this?

### **Day 3: Technical Deep Dive**
**Goal**: Validate complex technical scenarios

#### **Morning: Complex OpenAPI Scenarios**
Test prototype with challenging scenarios:
- **Polymorphism** (oneOf, anyOf, allOf)
- **Deep nesting** (5+ levels)
- **Complex authentication** (OAuth2, multiple auth schemes)  
- **Large specifications** (50+ endpoints)
- **Malformed specs** (common real-world issues)

#### **Afternoon: Performance & Scalability**
- Measure actual generation time vs. targets
- Test memory usage with large specs
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Validate 8-week timeline assumptions

### **Day 4: Team & Resource Validation**
**Goal**: Confirm team capabilities and resource requirements

#### **Team Skills Assessment**:
- [ ] TypeScript expertise level
- [ ] Node.js/CLI development experience
- [ ] OpenAPI/API testing knowledge
- [ ] Available development hours per week
- [ ] Team size and composition

#### **Timeline Reality Check**:
- Map prototype learnings to 8-week plan
- Identify optimistic vs. realistic estimates
- Account for integration, testing, documentation
- Validate buffer assumptions

#### **Budget Validation**:
- Development hours × rates
- Infrastructure costs (NPM, CI/CD, etc.)
- Third-party tools and licenses
- Contingency planning

### **Day 5: Integration & Success Metrics**
**Goal**: Define success metrics and integration requirements

#### **Success Metrics Definition**:
- **Time Savings**: Baseline current manual process (measure 5 developers)
- **Quality Metrics**: Generated test coverage and reliability
- **Adoption Metrics**: NPM downloads, user feedback
- **Technical Metrics**: Generation speed, error rates

#### **Integration Requirements**:
- How does this fit into existing development workflows?
- CI/CD integration requirements
- Documentation and onboarding needs
- Support and maintenance expectations

## 🚦 **Go/No-Go Decision Framework**

### **GREEN LIGHT (80%+ validation confidence)**
- All technical assumptions validated
- Strong market need confirmed  
- Team capability verified
- Clear path to success

**→ Proceed with MVP-Focused Architecture v3**

### **YELLOW LIGHT (60-79% validation confidence)**
- Most assumptions validated with some concerns
- Market need confirmed but solution needs adjustment
- Team capable but timeline/scope may need adjustment

**→ Proceed with modifications based on validation learnings**

### **RED LIGHT (<60% validation confidence)**  
- Core technical assumptions invalid
- Weak market need or poor solution fit
